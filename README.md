# Feature Matching Example

This is an example to show how feature point detection can be used to find a planer object in video images (VideoCapture in OpenCV).


## Install Python 3.5 and OpenCV 3

1. Download and install Anaconda3-4.2 (64bit version, python 3.5) from https://repo.continuum.io/archive/. (Note: Not the latest version)
1. Open Anaconda Prompt as administrator.
1. Install OpenCV.
   `> conda install -c mempo opencv3`

## How to use

1. Run the example code.
   `> python object_detection.py`
1. Press 'r' to register a query image with a target object. Then object detection will start.
1. Press 'q' to quit the detection.
